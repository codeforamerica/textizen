### Templates for print and digital
This library includes design assets that may be used as inspiration or templates for Textizen users creating their own materials for survey outreach.

`/concepts` contains .png and .jpg files as design concepts for how the initial survey question might be presented.

`/vector` contains .ai and .pdf files. They are editable in Adobe Illustrator and contain vector elements that may be reused in your own files.

For more information about distribution and deployment, see [Getting Started With Textizen](http://www.textizen.com/getstarted).

### Download the .zip archive
This is probably the easiest way to get access to the files. Download from Dropbox: [designtemplates.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdim9piv4wvndpc/designtemplates.zip).
